 // Ques. Leetcode reverse integer  time complexity---O(log x) space--O(1)
 
 
 /*To reverse the given number we need to do the following steps:

Extract last digit from right to left from the given number using the mod operator.

Put the extracted digit into its correct position in the result.

Discard the currently processed digit from the original number using divide operation.

Repeat steps 1 - 3 as long as the given value x is greater than 0.

The above steps can be represented using the formula:


result = result* 10 + currentDigit

And,

currentDigit = x%10

 int reverse(int x) {
        int ans=0; // reversed integer value

            if((ans>INT_MAX/10)||(ans<INT_MIN/10)){    // to check overflow and if it occurs we have to return 0
